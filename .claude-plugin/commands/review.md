---

Creates a new code review session in the current Git repository.

When user specifies a base branch (e.g., main, develop):
1. Calculate diff with current branch
2. Generate list of changed files
3. Create new review session

Once the session is created, you can proceed with review in the web UI or request AI auto-review.
